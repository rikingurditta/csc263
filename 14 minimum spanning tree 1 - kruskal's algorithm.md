## Minimum Spanning Trees

### Spanning Trees

- a (free) tree is an acyclic undirected connected graph
  - free because it is not implicitly directed, the way a rooted tree is
- simple facts about trees:
  - a connected graph with $n$ vertices and $n-1$ edges is a tree
  - adding one edge to a tree creates a unique cycle, deleting any edge from the cycle creates a tree
- a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ is a tree which contains every vertex in $V$ and has a subset of $G$'s edges so that it is a tree - $T = (V, E')$, $E' \subseteq E$
- the weight of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is $w(G) = \displaystyle \sum_{e \in E} w(e)$

### Minimum Spanning Tree problem

Given an undirected connected graph $G = (V, E)$ and a weight function $w : E \to \mathbb R$ (do not require weights to be non-negative), find a minimum weight spanning tree of $G$.

- a complete graph with $n$ vertices has $n^{n-2}$ spanning trees, so calculating the weight of each spanning tree and choosing the minimum weight would be ridiculously slow
- problem was originally solved by engineers deciding how to connect a power grid

## Kruskal's Algorithm

- Kruskal worked at Bell Labs, published this algorithm in 1956
- is a greedy algorithm

```python
def Kruskal(G):
    H = heap containing (e, w(e)) for each e in E
    S = disjoint set forest containing each v in V
    F = empty set  # trivial partial solution
    while |F| < n - 1:
        # greedily extend partial solution
        (u, v) = ExtractMin(H)  # find least weight edge
        # insert if u and v are not already connected
        if Find(u) != Find(v):
	        insert(F, (u, v))
            Union(u, v)  # mark u, v connected
    return F
```

### Runtime

- creating heap takes $\mathcal O(m)$ time
- creating initial disjoint set forest takes $\mathcal O(n)$ time
- `ExtractMin` is performed at most $m$ timesÂ as it starts with $m$ items, and each one takes at most $\log(m)$ time, however $m \leq n^2$ and $\log(n^2) = 2\log(n)$, so all `ExtractMin` operations take $\mathcal O(m \log(n))$
- unions and finds together take $\mathcal O(m \log^*(n))$ time in total

So in total, runtime complexity is $\mathcal O(m \log(n))$

### Correctness

#### Cut of a graph

a cut of $G = (V, E)$ is a partition of $V$ into $S \subseteq V$ and $\overline S = V \setminus S$

- $(u, v)$ *crosses* the cut if $u \in S$ and $v \in \overline S$

##### Cut property

Suppose $F \subseteq E$ is contained in some MST of $G$ ($F$ is a partial solution for the MST), $(S, \overline S)$ is a cut of $G$ so that no edge in $F$ crosses the cut, and $e$ is a minimum weight edge which crosses $(S, \overline S)$. Then $F \cup \{e\}$ is contained in some MST of $G$.

Proof.

Let $T$ be an MST of $G$.

If $e \in T$, then we are done.

If $e \notin T$, then adding $e$ to $T$ creates a unique cycle in $T$. This cycle contains $e' \neq e$ that crosses the cut. This is because if $e = (u, v)$ and $e$ is part of a cycle, then there must be another path from $u$ to $v$, which must cross the cut some other way.

Let $T' = (T \cup \{e\}) \setminus \{e' \}$, then $T$ must still be a spanning tree.

$w(T') = w(T) + w(e) - w(e')$

$e$ was a minimum weight edge crossing the cut and $e'$ was another edge crossing the cut, so $w(e) \leq w(e')$, so $w(T') \leq w(T)$

$T$ is an MST of G and $w(T') \leq w(T)$, so $T'$ must also be an MST of G

#### Loop Invariant

For the $i^\text{th}$ iteration,

1. $F_i$ has no cycles
2. $F_i$ is contained in some $MST$

**Base Case**

$F_0$ is empty, so it has no cycles and is contained in every MST.

**Inductive Step**

Suppose $F_k$ has no cycles and is contained in some MST.

$F_k = F_{i+1} \cup \{e\}$ and $e$ was chosen so that $F_{k+1}$ does not have any cycles, so $F_{k+1}$ has no cycles.

Let $S$  be the set of nodes that are connected by $F_k$ and $\overline S = V \setminus S$, then $e \in \overline S$. $e$ crosses this cut, and it was chosen to be a minimum-weight edge^[citation^ ^needed]^, so $F_{k+1}$ is also contained in an MST.

#### Conclusion

Since the loop invariant is true for every iteration, it is true when $|F| = n - 1$ aka when the loop terminates. Since $|F| = n - 1$, the resulting graph must be a spanning tree, so $F$ details a minimum spanning tree of $G$.
